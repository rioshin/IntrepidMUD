IntrepidMUD
===========

Welcome to IntrepidMUD. This software is a complex MUD, created to have the
same feel as the DIKU line of MUDs, but with a talkeresque feel to it, as
well, borrowed from the EW-Too line of talkers.

We've done our utmost to test the MUD on multiple platforms, to see if it
works correctly, and to debug it as well as possible. However, it is likely
that some bugs have slipped through our net, or that it refuses to work on
some platform it should be able to work on; in these cases, we would
greatly appreciate it if you would contact us at

and let us know about the problems you've encountered. Even better, if you
can supply us with a patch file to actually correct the problem. :)
