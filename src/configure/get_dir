# This script works out the ROOT macro for the MUD and sets it up in
# the header file 'include/root.h'. It is a hell of a lot more
# compilicated than you think because the script should not modify the
# file if the paths are the same.
# (if it did, you'd be recompiling every single file every 'make')
