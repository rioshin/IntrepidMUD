EMOTE <action>  - this is the most "general" type of communication. It
                  simply puts whatever you say after your name with no
                  "extras" added on and sends it to everyone in the same
                  room as you.

NOTE:   * EMOTE is aliased to : and ;

Examples:
        (If your name is Segtor)

        emote giggles             Segtor giggles
        emote 'll be right back   Segtor'll be right back
